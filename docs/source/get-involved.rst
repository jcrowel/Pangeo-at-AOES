AOES Python Club
##################

AOES has a weekly Python club. It is open to all AOES students, faculty, and staff and is entirely volunteer. There is no need to sign up.  Just come, learn new things, and help others.

The meetings consist of:
a) Presenting tools and tips
Did you figure out something that took you awhile?  Did you learn about a Python package that could be useful?  Share your knowledge with the group

b) Problem Solving 
Are you stuck on a data analysis problem in Python?  Present your problem to the group and we will help you solve it.

Python Club Meets every ther week during the semester on Mon @ Noon and Fri @ noon in the Clim Lab

Spring 2020 Dates: 2/3, 2/7, 2/17, 2/22, 3/2, 3/6, 3/16, 3/20, 3/23, 3/27, 4/6, 4/10, 4/20, 4/24, 4/4, 4/8
